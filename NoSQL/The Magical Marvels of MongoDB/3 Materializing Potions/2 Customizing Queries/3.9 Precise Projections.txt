1. Write a query that will find all wands, but this time project only the name field. Don't worry about the _id showing up in the results for now.

Answer:

db.wands.find( { }, { name: 1, _id: 0 } )

2. We've got all the names, but they're all jumbled up. Add a cursor method to sort the names alphabetically.

Answer:

db.wands.find( { }, { name: 1, _id: 0 } ).sort({ "name": 1})
