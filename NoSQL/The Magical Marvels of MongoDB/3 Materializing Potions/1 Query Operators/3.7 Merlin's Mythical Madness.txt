3.7 Merlin's Mythical Madness


Now that we're getting pretty good at finding wands, let's find the perfect wand for our friend Merlin.


Shell Editor

db.wands.find(
  
)


1. Merlin's first requirement is the wand must not be made by "Foxmond". Write the query to find wands that don't have "Foxmond" as the maker.

db.wands.find(
  { "maker": { "$ne": "Foxmond" } }
)

2. Next, Merlin's level is 75 so we'll want to add a query for a level_required that is less than or equal to 75.

Answer: 

Shell Editor

db.wands.find(
  { "maker": { "$ne": "Foxmond" }, "level_required": { "$lte": 75 } }
)

3. Merlin doesn't want to spend more than 50 gems. Add another query that makes sure the price is less than 50.

Answer: 

Shell Editor

db.wands.find(
  { "maker": { "$ne": "Foxmond" }, "level_required": {"$lte": 75 },
  "price": {"$lt": 50}
})

4. Lastly, make sure the wand is 3 to 4 banana lengths. Remember, arrays can be tricky!
