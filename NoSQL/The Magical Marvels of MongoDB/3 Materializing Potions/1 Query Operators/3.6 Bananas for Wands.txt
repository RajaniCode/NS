3.6 Bananas for Wands


Wands come in a variety of lengths, and the magic folk use bananas for measurement. We've added a new lengths field to each wand that contains an array of the different lengths a wand comes in.

To find a proper wand, we'll need one that fits our size.

Write a query that will find any wands that contain lengths that are greater than or equal to 2.5 but less than 3. Remember, arrays can be tricky!
