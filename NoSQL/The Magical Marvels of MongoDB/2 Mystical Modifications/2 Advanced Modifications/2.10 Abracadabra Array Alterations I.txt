2.10 Abracadabra Array Alterations I


We want to be the go-to source for wand information. Currently, we are listing one-word powers for each wand, but we should probably start being more specific. Here's the document we'll be working with:

{
  "_id": ObjectId("56016414959123c11810f9ad"),
  "name": "Dream Bender",
  "creator": "Foxmond",
  "level_required": 10,
  "price": 34.9,
  "powers": ["Fire", "Love"],
  "damage": {"magic": 4, "melee": 2}
}

Shell Editor

db.wands.update(
  {"name": "Dream Bender"},
  
)


For the wand above, let's add the update parameter to set the value of "Fire" to "Fire Deflection" in the powers array.

Remember that we only want to update a single array value, not all of the values in the array.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.update(
  {"name": "Dream Bender"},
  { "$set": { "powers.0":  "Fire Deflection" } } 
)
