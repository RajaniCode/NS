A user has asked us to find out which makers have wands that are under 50 gems and have a damage.magic average above 40.

1. Write an aggregate to match wands that have a price that is less than 50.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.aggregate([
  { "$match": { "price": { "$lt": 50 } } }
])

2. Add the aggregate stage to group the wands by their maker.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.aggregate([
  { "$match": { "price": { "$lt": 50 } } },
  { "$group": { "_id": "$maker" } }
])

3. Add an accumulator with a field named average_magic to find the average damage.magic per maker using the $avg accumulator.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.aggregate([
  { "$match": { "price": { "$lt": 50 } } },
  { "$group": { "_id": "$maker", "average_magic": { "$avg": "$damage.magic" }  } }
])

4. Now that we've got our data all set, go ahead and filter it down so that we're only retrieving makers that have wands with an average_magic that's greater than 40.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.aggregate([
  { "$match": { "price": { "$lt": 50 } } },
  { "$group": { "_id": "$maker", "average_magic": { "$avg": "$damage.magic" }  } },
  { "$match": { "average_magic": {"$gt": 40 } } }
])
