5.8 Lower-level Castings


Some wand powers can be harder to find in lower-level wands. We've heard that the power "Air Bolt" is a really fun one to have. Let's find out which makers offer a wand with that power and find the lowest level_required per maker.

1. Write an aggregate that will only match wands that have "Air Bolt" in their list of powers.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.aggregate([
  { "$match": { "powers": "Air Bolt" } }
])

2. Add another aggregate stage to group the data by their maker.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.aggregate([
  { "$match": { "powers": "Air Bolt" } },
  { "$group": { "_id": "$maker" } }
])

3. Add an accumulator with a field named lowest_level that finds the lowest level_required per maker.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.aggregate([
  { "$match": { "powers": "Air Bolt" } },
  { "$group": { "_id": "$maker", "lowest_level": {"$min": "$level_required"}  } }
])
