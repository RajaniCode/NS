1.2 Dispelling the Database


We've inherited a database that stores information about magic wands.

A MongoDB shell has been started below, so write the command that will set the current database to wandRecorder.

Remember, if you ever forget a command, you can use help.


Answer: use wandRecorder

Type help to see the help menu

> use wandRecorder

switched to db wandRecorder

Congratulations, you're correct!
