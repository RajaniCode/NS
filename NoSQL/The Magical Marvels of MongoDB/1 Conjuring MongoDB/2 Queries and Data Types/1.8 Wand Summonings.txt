1.8 Wand Summonings


There's a lot more about wands than just their name and creator, so let's add a new wand with much more detailed information.


Shell Editor

{
  "name": "Dream Bender",
  "creator": "Foxmond"
}


1. Some wands require more experience than others. Let's record the minimum level needed to use a wand in a field named level_required. This particular wand requires level 10.

Answer:

Shell Editor

{
  "name": "Dream Bender",
  "creator": "Foxmond",
  "level_required": 10
}

2. We would never think of selling our wand, but it's fun to know how much it's worth anyway. Let's record the price of our wand in a field named price. This particular wand is worth 34.9 gems.

Answer:

Shell Editor

{
  "name": "Dream Bender",
  "creator": "Foxmond",
  "level_required": 10, 
  "price": 34.9
}

3. Each wand can have any number of special powers, like Fire, Teleportation, or Energy. Let's record all of these power options in a field named powers. This particular wand has powers of "Fire" and "Love", which should be stored in an array.

Answer:

Shell Editor

{
  "name": "Dream Bender",
  "creator": "Foxmond",
  "level_required": 10, 
  "price": 34.9,
  "powers": ["Fire", "Love"]
}

4. Magical folk are a peace-loving people, but occasionally they need to throw down, so it's a good idea to store each wand's damage capability in a field named damage. Most wands can cause 2 types of damage — magic and melee.

The value of the damage field should be an object with 2 properties. The magic property for this wand is 4, and the melee property is 2.

Answer:

Shell Editor

{
  "name": "Dream Bender",
  "creator": "Foxmond",
  "level_required": 10, 
  "price": 34.9,
  "powers": ["Fire", "Love"],
  "damage": { "magic": 4, "melee": 2  }
}

5. Now that we've built out a wand with all the correct information, go ahead and insert it into the wands collection.

Answer:

Shell Editor

db.wands.insert({
  "name": "Dream Bender",
  "creator": "Foxmond",
  "level_required": 10, 
  "price": 34.9,
  "powers": ["Fire", "Love"],
  "damage": { "magic": 4, "melee": 2  }
})
